# General #
Language: english

always write a commit log.

even for wiki and also if it is just a small change.

test/preview before commiting.

Wiki syntax: https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax

Using Tortoise svn tutorial: http://www.igorexchange.com/node/87

# scripting/other games files #
comment code

use camelCase

spell check names of variables etc

formating in a way that makes sense

no .cob, only .lua

no .3do, only .s3o (or .obj if that is working?)

# variations on stuff #
ideally there should be a really simple version of each _thing_
The "base name" should be the same for all variations, just prefix and suffix should be aded.

The most simple version should be prefixed with **simple**
That way is easy to find them, in game folder and in /give command
Advanced versions should add suffixs describing what was added.

Using the example of a unit:
a armed unit: called attackvehicle

**simpleattackvehicle** - drives,aims,shots, very basic.

**attackvehicledoublebarrel** - more advanced script: shots from 2 barrels.

**attackvehiclemultiweapon** - has two turrets that aim independently.

**attackvehicleamphi** - can drive in water, movement speed changes when in water
