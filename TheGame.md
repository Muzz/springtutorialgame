wondering what is needed?

Pick a topic and start adding stuff.
Or creation a new section I forgott.

# Units #
there need to be some [Units](Units.md)

# Weapons #
there need to be some [Weapons](Weapons.md)

# Lua gadgets #
there needs to be at least something to spawn start units

# other files #
modinfo.lua, etc...
