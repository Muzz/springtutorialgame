#summary how to add stuff
#labels workflow,howtodostuff,readbeforestartingtoworkonsomething

To avoid multiple working on the same stuff, there needs to be some organization.

Let's try it like this:

1) See what is needed at TODO page <- todo: create a TODO page

2) Create an issue describing what you want to do.

3) Wait for feedback. (somebody doing the same thing, work is not needed etc)

4) Start doing stuff

5) commit

6) give reports in the issue thread
