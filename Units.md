The idea is not to show very complex animations or nice modeling but to have one basic unit of each type.
There needs to be units of various complexity.
Sorted from "simple" to "complex" that might be:

-mobile unit without weapon (the aiming/fire script is very confusing for newbs) and without animation<br>
This unit is: <a href='Unit_SimpleHover.md'>Unit_SimpleHover</a>
The issue is: <a href='http://code.google.com/p/springtutorialgame/issues/detail?id=1'>http://code.google.com/p/springtutorialgame/issues/detail?id=1</a>


-mobile unit with weapon. to show use of weapons and the aiming/fire script.<br>
This unit is: [<a href='Unit_SimpleAttackVehicle.md'>Unit_SimpleAttackVehicle</a>]<br>
<br>
-a building<br>
<br>
-a factory.<br>
<br>
-a mobile builder.<br>
